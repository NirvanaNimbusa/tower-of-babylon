Tower of Babylon
================

Genetic algorithm solution to the [Tower of Babylon problem](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/4/437.html).

There are many solutions to this problem using brute-force or dynamic programming. This is the first solution using genetic algorithm, where the genome is the sequence of blocks and fitness function for survival of individual is directly proportional to the total height. In most cases, given enough large population, this algorithm will find the correct solution.
